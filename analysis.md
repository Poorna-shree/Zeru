# Credit Score Analysis Report

## Score Distribution

The credit scores range from 0 to 1000, representing wallet reliability and risk. The histogram below (see `credit_score_distribution.png`) shows the distribution of scores across all wallets:

- Majority of wallets cluster in the mid-range (400-700), indicating moderate activity and repayment behavior
- A smaller proportion have very high scores (>900), indicating frequent deposits, high repay ratio, and diversified tokens
- Some wallets score low (<200), potentially reflecting exploitative or bot-like behavior, low repayments, or liquidation events

## Behavior Insights

- Wallets with high `repay_ratio` and multiple deposits tend to have higher scores, reflecting responsible borrowing and repayment
- Wallets interacting with more unique tokens are likely more diversified, which correlates with higher scores
- Average transaction amount moderately affects scores, rewarding wallets with consistent and reasonable transaction sizes

## Limitations

- Current scoring does not factor in liquidation events or time decay of transactions
- No supervised labels available; scoring is heuristic based on domain knowledge
- Further validation with real-world risk data would improve robustness

## Conclusion

This credit scoring framework provides a transparent, extensible way to quantify wallet trustworthiness based solely on transaction history. It forms a solid foundation for more advanced DeFi credit risk assessment models.
